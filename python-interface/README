Explanation
Waypoint Interface: Connects to PX4 using MAVLink and sends a waypoint to the specified latitude, longitude, and altitude.
Keyboard Control: Listens for keyboard inputs and sends corresponding manual control commands to PX4.
Testing
Simulation: Run these scripts with a PX4 SITL (Software In The Loop) environment or a real drone setup to test.
Connection String: Ensure the connection string ('udp:127.0.0.1:14550' in the examples) matches your PX4 setup. For instance, you might need to adjust the IP address and port for real hardware or different configurations.
Feel free to adjust these libraries based on your specific requirements or additional features you want to implement!
